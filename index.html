            <P>My name is Brandy Riegel. I am 23 years old, my birthdate is November 30th 1994. I was born and raised in West Chester Pennsylvina and I still live there.</P>
            <P>I graduated from Henderson High School in 2013 and went to the University of West Virgina before transering to Bloomsburg University. I am taking a break from getting my degree in history and seeing where this bootcamp will take me.</P>
            <p> Right now I work as a Payroll specialist for a company called Edens Corporation. We hire the ticket agents that sell you your SEPTA train tickes and the Ambassadors that are stationed at the stations to help with any questions that a patron might have. Though I am fairly certin they don't actually do anything other then stand around. A lot of them get fired for sleeping on the job.</p>
            <P>I have a 12 month old son whose name is Jaxson Riegel. He is adorable.I have an older sister who is living in Scotland, studying to be a Vet. We have one dog, a pug named Pheobe and a cat named Xena.</P>
